Excellent question — let’s break this down clearly 👇

## 🧠 What Nginx Is

**Nginx (pronounced “engine-x”)** is a high-performance **web server**, **reverse proxy**, and **load balancer**.
It’s designed to handle **massive numbers of concurrent connections** efficiently.

---

## ⚙️ How Nginx Works (Simplified)

### 1. **Acts as a Gateway**

When users send requests (like `https://myapp.com/login`), Nginx sits **in front** of your application servers.

```
Client ---> Nginx ---> Application Server(s)
```

---

### 2. **Load Balancing**

If you have multiple backend instances (e.g., 4 Spring Boot WebFlux servers), Nginx can **distribute** requests among them:

#### Example:

You have 4 backend pods or instances:

```
app1:8080
app2:8081
app3:8082
app4:8083
```

Nginx `nginx.conf` might contain:

```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    server app1:8080;
    server app2:8081;
    server app3:8082;
    server app4:8083;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
    }
}
```

✅ When 100,000 login requests come in:

* Nginx balances them among the 4 servers.
* Each server may process 25,000 requests.
* It can use strategies like:

  * **Round Robin** (default)
  * **Least Connections**
  * **IP Hash**
  * **Weighted Round Robin**

---

### 3. **Reverse Proxy**

It hides your backend servers.
Clients never connect to `app1` or `app2` directly — they only see **Nginx**.

This gives you:

* Security (backend IPs hidden)
* SSL termination (Nginx handles HTTPS)
* Caching (faster responses)
* Compression (smaller payloads)

---

### 4. **Scalability**

If load increases, you can add more backend servers and update the `upstream` configuration —
or if using **Kubernetes**, this happens automatically via the **Ingress Controller**.

---

### 5. **Kubernetes Integration**

In Kubernetes, Nginx runs as an **Ingress Controller**, automatically routing traffic to pods via:

```
Client -> Nginx Ingress -> Service -> Pods
```

So Nginx + Kubernetes together can handle **hundreds of thousands** of requests efficiently.
