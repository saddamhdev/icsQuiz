Perfect 👍
If your goal is **software quality (not just “does it run”)**, then we should evaluate your quiz app using **standard Software Quality dimensions** — the way **SQA teams, auditors, and enterprise clients** do it.

Below is a **clear, practical Software Quality Check Framework** you can apply **today** to your Quiz App.

## 🧩 Software Quality = What exactly?

In Software Engineering, quality is usually measured using **ISO/IEC 25010** model.

We’ll focus on **what actually matters for a quiz/exam system**.

---

## ✅ 1. Functional Correctness (MOST CRITICAL)

**Question:**

> Does the system do exactly what it is supposed to do?

### Checklist

* [ ] Correct questions delivered
* [ ] Correct options shown
* [ ] Correct answer stored
* [ ] Correct score calculation
* [ ] Correct result after submission
* [ ] No duplicate submissions
* [ ] Timer logic is accurate

🔴 **Automatic FAIL** if:

* Score mismatch
* Duplicate submission
* Timer wrong by even a few seconds

---

## ⚡ 2. Performance & Efficiency

**Question:**

> Is the app fast enough under load?

### Key Metrics

| Area            | Target   |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Page load       | < 2 sec  |
| Submit response | < 1 sec  |
| API p95 latency | < 500 ms |
| CPU usage       | < 70%    |
| DB connections  | Stable   |

### Quick Test (Today)

* Open 20–30 concurrent quiz sessions
* Submit answers together
* Watch:

  * Response delay
  * DB pool usage
  * Memory growth

⚠️ Warning signs:

* Sudden latency spikes
* Hikari pool exhaustion
* High GC activity

---

## 🛡️ 3. Reliability & Stability

**Question:**

> Does the system behave correctly when things go wrong?

### Test These

* Refresh page during quiz
* Network disconnect → reconnect
* Browser crash → reopen
* Server restart mid-quiz
* Duplicate API calls

Expected behavior:

* No data loss
* No corrupted attempts
* Graceful recovery or auto-submit

---

## 🔐 4. Security Quality (VERY IMPORTANT for Exams)

**Minimum Checks**

* [ ] Passwords hashed (BCrypt)
* [ ] JWT/session expiration enforced
* [ ] No answer leakage via API
* [ ] No quiz access without auth
* [ ] Rate limit login & submit
* [ ] CSRF/XSS protected

### Red Flags 🚩

* Can fetch answers via API
* Can submit twice
* Can bypass timer
* HttpOnly=false for auth cookies

---

## 🧠 5. Usability & UX Quality

**Question:**

> Can a non-technical student use it without confusion?

### Check

* Clear instructions
* Visible timer
* Answer selected state obvious
* Warning before submit
* Mobile responsiveness
* Error messages meaningful

🧪 Real test:

> Give the app to **1 person** and don’t explain anything.
> If they struggle → UX quality is low.

---

## 🔄 6. Maintainability (Developer Quality)

**Question:**

> Can this system be safely changed later?

### Check Codebase

* Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repo)
* No business logic in controllers
* Reusable services
* Central exception handling
* Proper logging (not println)

📌 Example:

```java
QuizSubmissionService.submitQuiz(...)
```

✔️ Good
❌ Logic directly in controller

---

## 📈 7. Scalability Readiness

**Question:**

> Can this system grow?

Check:

* Stateless APIs
* Redis for session/cache
* Async messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
* DB indexing
* Pagination everywhere

Even if today users = 50
Quality = ability to handle 50,000 later.

---

## 🧪 8. Testability (Hidden but Important)

* Unit tests for scoring logic
* Integration tests for submit flow
* Test data isolation
* Predictable test outcomes

If a bug appears:

> Can you reproduce it easily?

If NO → low quality.

---

## 🧾 Final Software Quality Scorecard (Use This)

Rate each (0–5):

| Area                   | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Functional correctness | ⬜     |
| Performance            | ⬜     |
| Reliability            | ⬜     |
| Security               | ⬜     |
| Usability              | ⬜     |
| Maintainability        | ⬜     |
| Scalability            | ⬜     |

**Total (out of 35):**

* **30–35** → Production-ready
* **24–29** → Usable but risky
* **<24** → Needs fixes before real exam
